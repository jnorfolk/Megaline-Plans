# Megaline-Plans
Practicum Sprint 3 Project - Statistical Data Analysis

This was my third project during my Practicum data science program, where I analyzed a sample of Megaline phone plan users, subscribed to two plans. 
I evaluated the quality of the data, made corrections and created columns where necessary.
I used statistical testing to determine whether or not the two plans generate more revenue from a typical user.
